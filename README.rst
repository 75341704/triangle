*Python Triangle* is a python wrapper around Jonathan Richard Shewchuk's
two-dimensional quality mesh generator and delaunay triangulator library,
available `here <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html>`_.

This implementation of python triangle utilizes cython to wrap the C API as
closely as possible.
